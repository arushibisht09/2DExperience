// some notes for my knowledge :

// Java does not limit the number of interfaces you can implement .
// We have implemented Runnable as java only supports single inheritance and it
// lets us define the run() method - what the thread should do.
// by implementing the runnable class we can extend it to JPanel
// 1. when we do multithreading - we have no idea how the threads work(in which order).
// 2. If one thread runs into an exception , it will not affect others.
// With Runnable we just change the implementation of the run method and nothing else needs to be changed(except making a thread object).
